be sure that virtualbox is installed

download latest debian minimal ISO

Getting Debian -> Small CD's, Flexible USB Sticks etc

--> Network install from a minimal CD

--> AMD64 (I suggest you use bittorrent to download it)

Go into Virtualbox 

Create a virt with 512m of ram, debian linux, 8G disk dynamically allocated.
Click on Settings -> Network -> Adapter 2  -> attached to (Internal Network)
name (tgemail) 

Click advanced be sure promiscuous mode is Deny and Cable is connected.

Virtualbox -> Settings -> Network -> Port Forwarding -> Guest 22, Host 2222

Click Start

Navigate to the Debian ISO you downloaded

Click Start

Debian Install -> Hit enter through most

Use Eth0 for interface for install

use tgemailgw for admin user

Partitioning -> guided use entire disk

Click through with defaults

let installer format the system

find a software mirror 

install only ssh server and standard system utilities - remove others

Once system is up and running

apt-get install tor

Start Up a WHONIX system`

Create shared folder in virtualbox on the whonix system to enable copying - 
ssh is not installed and is not easy to install on virtualbox gatways.

copy /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix (from whonix) to tgemail-gateway

copy /etc/network/interfaces (from whonix) to tgemail-gateway

copy /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc (from whonix) to /etc/tor/torrc on tgemail-gateway

Comment out "SocksPort unix:/var/run/tor/socks WorldWritable"

### Add this to /etc/tor/torrc
# This allows for 8 tor clients add more if needed create names with pwgen random usernames are important
